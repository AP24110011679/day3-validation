This repository contains my Day-3 Python Challenge submission.The program takes marks of multiple students, validates them (0–100 only), classifies performance based on marks, and prints a final summary of valid and failed students.
Program Description
Starts with a predefined name and calculates its length
Takes the number of students as input
Collects marks using a loop.
Validates each mark.
Classifies performance as:
Excellent
Very Good
Good
Average
Fail
Counts total valid students.
Counts total failed students.
Prints "(Checked)" if the name length is even.
Displays a final summary. 
Grading Criteria
90+ → Excellent
75–89 → Very Good
60–74 → Good
40–59 → Average
Below 40 → Fail
<0 or >100 → Invalid
How to Run
Save the file as student_performance.py
Run using:
python student_performance.py
